                        <h3>Nurture healthy relationships</h3>
                        <p class="para">
                            Nurturing healthy relationships is essential for our mental health and overall well-being.
                            Healthy relationships
                            provide us with emotional support, a sense of belonging, and a safe space for sharing our
                            thoughts and feelings.
                            Effective communication is at the core of these relationships, involving active listening,
                            honest and respectful
                            expression, and openness to understanding different perspectives. Building trust and respect
                            is fundamental in
                            maintaining healthy relationships.

                        <h3>Limit screen time and establish boundaries</h3>
                        <p class="para">
                            When we spend excessive time on screens, we may neglect other important aspects of our
                            lives, such as physical
                            activity, social interactions, and self-care. By becoming aware of our screen time habits
                            and setting specific
                            goals, we can regain control over our digital consumption. This might involve allocating
                            dedicated hours for
                            work-related tasks, leisure activities, and social media use. By establishing clear
                            boundaries, we can ensure that
                            technology does not encroach upon our personal lives and negatively impact our mental
                            well-being. By letting
                            family members, friends, and colleagues know about our preferences and limits, we can manage
                            their expectations
                            and encourage a supportive environment that respects our need for screen-free time.

                            Engaging in alternative activities is a valuable mental health tip that can contribute to
                            our overall well-being and
                            help us find balance in our lives. By consciously seeking out activities that promote
                            relaxation, joy, and personal
                            growth, we can prioritize our mental health and cultivate a fulfilling lifestyle.Finding
                            alternative activities
                            involves exploring new hobbies, interests, and experiences that don't solely rely on screens
                            or digital devices.
                            By diversifying our activities, we can reduce dependency on technology and create a more
                            well-rounded approach to
                            our mental well-being.

                        <p class="para">
                            Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by
                            skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. This includes
                            exercise and activities undertaken while working, playing,
                            carrying out household chores, travelling, and engaging in
                            recreational pursuits. The amount of physical activity you need
                            depends on your age group but adults aged 18-64 years should do
                            at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity
                            throughout the week. Increase moderate-intensity physical
                            activity to 300 minutes per week for additional health benefits.

                        <p class="para">
                            Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is called a “silent
                            killer”. This is because many people who have hypertension may
                            not be aware of the problem as it may not have any symptoms. If
                            left uncontrolled, hypertension can lead to heart, brain, kidney
                            and other diseases. Have your blood pressure checked regularly
                            by a health worker so you know your numbers. If your blood
                            pressure is high, get the advice of a health worker. This is
                            vital in the prevention and control of hypertension.

                        <p class="para">
                            Practicing stress management techniques is a crucial aspect of maintaining good mental
                            health. Chronic stress can have a significant negative impact on our well-being, leading to
                            anxiety, depression, and other health problems. By incorporating effective stress management
                            strategies into our daily lives, we can reduce the harmful effects of stress and enhance our
                            overall mental well-being.

                            One key stress management technique is regular exercise. Physical activity releases
                            endorphins, which are natural mood boosters, and helps to reduce stress levels. Engaging in
                            activities such as walking, jogging, yoga, or dancing can provide a release of tension and
                            promote a sense of relaxation and rejuvenation.

                        <p class="para">
                            Depression is a common illness worldwide with over 260 million
                            people affected. Depression can manifest in different ways, but
                            it might make you feel hopeless or worthless, or you might think
                            about negative and disturbing thoughts a lot or have an
                            overwhelming sense of pain. If you're going through this,
                            remember that you are not alone. Talk to someone you trust such
                            as a family member, friend, colleague or mental health
                            professional about how you feel. If you feel that you are in
                            danger of harming yourself, contact the National Center for
                            Mental Health hotline at 1800-599-0019.

                        <h3>Set realistic goals</h3>
                        <p class="para">
                            Setting realistic goals is a crucial aspect of maintaining good mental health. When it comes
                            to goal setting, starting small is key. Breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable
                            steps not only prevents overwhelming feelings but also allows for a sense of progress and
                            accomplishment along the way. By being specific about what you want to achieve and
                            establishing measurable criteria, you provide clarity and focus to your goals, making it
                            easier to stay motivated and track your progress.

                            It's important to consider your limitations when setting goals. Take into account your
                            current resources, time availability, and energy levels. Setting goals that are realistic
                            and feasible within your circumstances increases the likelihood of success and prevents
                            feelings of disappointment or failure.
