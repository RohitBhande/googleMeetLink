                Nurturing healthy relationships is essential for our mental health and overall well-being. Healthy relationships
                provide us with emotional support, a sense of belonging, and a safe space for sharing our thoughts and feelings.
                Effective communication is at the core of these relationships, involving active listening, honest and respectful
                expression, and openness to understanding different perspectives. Building trust and respect is fundamental in
                maintaining healthy relationships.

              <h3>Limit screen time and establish boundaries</h3>
              <p className="para">
                When we spend excessive time on screens, we may neglect other important aspects of our lives, such as physical
                activity, social interactions, and self-care. By becoming aware of our screen time habits and setting specific
                goals, we can regain control over our digital consumption. This might involve allocating dedicated hours for
                work-related tasks, leisure activities, and social media use. By establishing clear boundaries, we can ensure that
                technology does not encroach upon our personal lives and negatively impact our mental well-being. By letting
                family members, friends, and colleagues know about our preferences and limits, we can manage their expectations
                and encourage a supportive environment that respects our need for screen-free time.

              <h3>Find alternative activities</h3>
              <p className="para">
                Engaging in alternative activities is a valuable mental health tip that can contribute to our overall well-being and
                help us find balance in our lives. By consciously seeking out activities that promote relaxation, joy, and personal
                growth, we can prioritize our mental health and cultivate a fulfilling lifestyle. Finding alternative activities
                involves exploring new hobbies, interests, and experiences that don't solely rely on screens or digital devices.
                By diversifying our activities, we can reduce dependency on technology and create a more well-rounded approach to
                our mental well-being.

In this React component, I've used JSX syntax to represent the HTML structure. Each HTML element is converted into its corresponding JSX syntax, and the class attributes are replaced with the `className` attribute since `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.

Note that the images' source paths (`src`) in the `<img>` tags are relative paths. Make sure to provide the correct paths to your image files or update them accordingly.

Remember to import the necessary CSS stylesheets and assets in your React component for the styles and images to work correctly.

Feel free to modify the component according to your needs, and let me know if you have any further questions!
